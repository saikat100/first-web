            <p>As one of the hottest topics for developers, the discussions have never stopped. On LinkedIn and Facebook, lots of people put their job title as a full stack developer. Besides, it seems that the “Full Stack” topic has already become a new job trend. An article on Medium has discussed the full stack designer getting both praise and blame. Some people think that the full stack is just a title, what he/she should focus on is the real personal ability and technology.</p>

            <p>The course has been created with a lot of thought and planning. Each topic related to the one before. Rob not only teaches he shows on this course how to google the information needed, which I've been doing and I've learnt a lot from this method of teaching. I've nearly finished the course and I feel very confident to send my CV to potential empolyers. Thanks for an excellent course. Rayaa</p>
